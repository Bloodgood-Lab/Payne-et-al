% Issues to resolve:
%   - Implement step 3: get linearized rate maps
%   - Implement step 1
%   - Implement step 2

% Steps:
%   1) Use opto-tagging to identify WT and KO neurons
%   2) Get spiking metrics (i.e. firing rate and burst index)
%   3) Get the linearized rate maps

%% Step 3: Get the linearized rate maps
